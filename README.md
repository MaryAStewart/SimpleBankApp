# SimpleBankApp
This is a project that demonstrates Array Lists and AutoBoxing. To look at the Java files please click on the src folder. 
You will see the Main Class, the Bank Class, the Branch Class and the Customer Class. The PNG is the view of the console
when the app is run from the Main Class.  The Main Class is where some testing of the different methods was done.  All
the methods are working as expected.
